# Simple Rust Calculator

A simple calculator application built with Rust using the `eframe` and `egui` libraries. This calculator supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, and percentage calculation. It also provides a responsive GUI for ease of use.

## Features

- **Basic arithmetic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced operations**: Square and Percentage.
- **Error handling**: Display error messages for invalid operations.
- **Responsive user interface**: Built with `eframe` and `egui` to provide a smooth experience.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Rust**: If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- **Cargo**: Cargo comes with Rust, so if you've installed Rust, you also have Cargo.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeeKapil/Rustulator.git
   cd Rustulator
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   Run the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   After building the project, run it using the command:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   This will launch the calculator window with a simple interface.

## Usage

The calculator features a text input for entering mathematical expressions and buttons for performing operations. Here’s how to use the application:

- **Enter numbers**: Simply type numbers using the keyboard or click the number buttons.
- **Operators**: Click on the operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `x²`, `%`) to perform the respective operations.
- **Clear**: Click the `C` button to clear the input.
- **Negate**: Click `+/-` to negate the current input.
- **Result**: Press `=` to evaluate the expression and display the result.

## Example

### Basic Operations:
- `2 + 2 = 4`
- `5 × 3 = 15`
- `8 ÷ 2 = 4`

### Advanced Operations:
- `25 x² = 625`
- `50% = 0.5`
- `+/-` changes the sign of the current value.
